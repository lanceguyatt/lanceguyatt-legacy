The .info file contains the icon image and its spatial position within its parent window. The icon also specifies the type of the file, as used by Workbench. Workbench recognises five different file types:[4]

* Tool: An executable program.
* Project: A data file of an executable program. The program which created the file is named in the icon file, double-clicking on the icon loads the program that created it.
* Drawer: A directory containing files, and other drawers.
* Volume: A physical disk or a RAM disk.
* Garbage: The Trashcan â€“ a deleted file backup, which works in a similar way to the 'Recycle bin' in Microsoft Windows.
